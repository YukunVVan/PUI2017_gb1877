## Steps I took to setup the environment

- Open the terminal and login to compute
- Once you're there create a directory PUI2017
- Now to access this directory go to home by typing cd and oen the bash prfile by 'nano ~/.bashrc'
- Now edit the profile with export command following the complete path of yor PUI directory

- After that create an alias pui2017 so that you can access the directory just by typing it. To do that, type alias "alias name"="path to directory"

- Once that is done, go back to home and type pwd and check the directory. Now type in the alias and pwd again. See if the current working directory changed.
