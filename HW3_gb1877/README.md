### Assignment 1

In this assignment I took the skeleton from Professor Bianco's notebook and executed the code for 4 other distribution namely Normal, Exponential, Poisson and Binomial.

I've plotted 3 graphs for each distribution where 1st plot represents the distribution for 1 sample. The 2nd plot represents the distribution for 100 samples and the 3rd one shows the distribution of the means of that distribution.

I chose the seed as 101 and probability for Binomial distribution as 0.2

I worked with Rachel for the extra credit assignment to get the gaussian plot with the average mean plot of all distributions.

### Assignment 2

In this assignment I followed the instructions given in Professor Bianco's notebook. I couldn't use the directory so I downloaded the zip file from citibike;s website and uploaded it to PUIdata directory. 

I discussed my hypothesis with Rachel and Unisse and modified it after their getting their insights.

### Assignment 3

In this assignment, I used the methods learnt in lab 3 and the values along with hypothesis are the same as discussed in class last week.
